I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Mathematics at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University (starting from 2025). Before, I received my Bachelor's in Mathematics at School of Mathematical Sciences, Nankai University in 2025.

My work currently revolves around: Bayesian inverse problems, sampling methods, variational inference, uncertainty quantification.
